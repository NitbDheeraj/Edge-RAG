🚀 Build a Private, Offline RAG System on Your Laptop — No Cloud, No API Keys!
Forget sending your confidential documents to the cloud. I built a fully local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that runs 100% offline on a laptop. 
To Run the code

1. Clone this repo
2. Pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download any SLM/TinyLLM and any embedding model on your local. Update the config.yaml file
4. Run "python ui.py"
